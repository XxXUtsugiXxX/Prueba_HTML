• Instructions for cloning a git repository

To clone the repository, go to Git and copy the repository URL. Open the terminal and navigate to the location where you want the cloned folder to be saved (Desktop, Documents, etc.). Once you're in the desired location, copy `git clone` followed by the repository URL into the terminal and press Enter. If you want to modify and then push the same file, use `git pull` from the terminal.
